## Abstract

This paper examines the UK Civil Service’s participatory practices at the London Design Biennale through the lens of [_Epistemic Clientelism Theory_](https://github.com/Peter-Kahl/Epistemic-Clientelism-Theory) (ECT). Drawing on fiduciary law, deliberative democracy, and critical social theory, it argues that the workshops—framed as “serious games”—constituted not democratic innovation but structural breaches of fiduciary–epistemic duty. Participation was curated, scripted, and opaque, producing symbolic inclusion while suppressing dissent and epistemic plurality.

A central contribution of this paper is the articulation of **Fairness Duties in Participatory Design**—notice (_Ridge v Baldwin_), reasons (_Doody_), access (_UNISON_), and proportionality (_Mott_). Transposed from public law into the epistemic domain, these duties specify the obligations institutions owe to citizens when structuring participatory processes. Case law on fiduciary loyalty (_Keech v Sandford_; _Boardman v Phipps_) and fiduciary power in state contexts (_Frame v Smith_; _Guerin v The Queen_) further anchors this framework.

The result is a normative blueprint for reform: _fiduciary–epistemic governance_ that embeds transparency, accountability, reflexivity, and democratic co-creation. By integrating jurisprudence with deliberative theory (Habermas, Gutmann & Thompson), the paper advances both doctrinal and democratic innovation, recasting participatory governance not as theatre but as a fiduciary relationship grounded in epistemic justice.
